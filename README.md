# PyGridWorld
PyGridWorld is a tool created to study neural network behavior and evolution. PyGridWorld creates neural network entities which it places into a 2D simulation provided by the [GridWorld](https://github.com/MidZik/gridworld) module, then records their performance and evolves new neural networks based on high performers.

PyGridWorld also provides some basic displays of the simulation state using pyglet, and real time graphs of a simulation's best performing neural network entities using matplotlib.

## Dependencies
